The app possesses a graphic user interface at `localhost:4000`

```sh
execute 'npm start' to launch
```

There's a command to run the application in the debug mode (temporarily doesn't work after migration to TS):
```sh
execute 'npm run dev' to launch in the debug mode
```

There's a command to run a sintax analysis of the code (launched by default by means of `Husky` as a pre-commit step)
```sh
npm run lint
```
